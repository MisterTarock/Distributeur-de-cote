#Distributeur de cotes

This is our project in **C#** to understand the concept of **object programming**.
Our little program can access data about some students, courses, etc.

When you'll launch our program, it will display some options:
- 1)See Bulletin
- 2)see who attends an activity
- 3)See the activity average
- 4)List different entities
- 5)Dunno LOL
- 6)Exit

#Navigation in the Menu

##First Choice
:collision: Attention please! If you write anything other than the expected numbers it will show an exception and reload the propositions.

if you chose the *1)* you'll be asked to choose a student.
:collision: You need to write his name correctly and entirely in order the program to work ;)

If the student is not recognized, the program will say that there is "No such person"

If the student is recognized, it will display his complete name with all his courses,
the number of ects of the courses, the evaluation for each activity and the final average.

If the student has not yet any evaluation, the program will say it.

After that you can consult another student or write "exit" to return at the main menu.


##Second Choice
if you chose the *2)* you'll be proposed to choose an activity.
Write the name of the activity and it will display the students who are attending this lecture.

##Third Choice
if you chose the *3)* you'll be proposed to choose an activity.
Write the name of the chosen activity and it will display the average of all the students
who are attending this lecture.

##Fourth Choice
if you chose the *4)* you'll be proposed to chose again between
- 1)Teachers
- 2)Students
- 3)Activities
- 4)Exit

and it will display the different contents of the correspondant *.csv file*

##Fifth Choice
if you chose the *6)* you receive a perfect ASCII guy who doesn't know a thing!


##Sixth Choice
if you chose the *5)* you'll exit the program.
